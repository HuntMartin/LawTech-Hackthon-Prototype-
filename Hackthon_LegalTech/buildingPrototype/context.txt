n New Zealand, you might be helped by consumer law if your car is broken, specifically the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA), which provides rights to a repair, replacement, or refund for faulty goods. The Fair Trading Act (FTA) also protects you from misleading or deceptive practices by businesses. If you're struggling financially due to a broken car and job loss, seeking assistance from a Community Law Centre for free legal advice can be helpful, as they offer free one-on-one legal advice to people with limited finances.
